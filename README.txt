The purpose of this project is to integrate a student't schedule at UF with the RecSports classes that they believe best interest them.
The web app will ask for the students schedules for the semester and return a time sheet with all the possible RecSports classes that the
student can sign up for. The selection of classes will also depend on the preferences of activities that the student selects, whether they
be cardio intensive or weighted more heavily on muscle building.
